## Development

```
pod install
```

Read our [development guidelines](DEVELOPMENT.md) to get a sense of how we think about working on this codebase.

## Environments

The architecture of the Client API means that you'll need to develop against a merchant server when developing braintree-ios. The merchant server uses a server side client library such as [`braintree_ruby`](https://github.com/braintree/braintree_ruby) to coordinate with a particular Braintree Gateway environment. The various Gateway environments, such as `development`, `sandbox` and `production`, in turn determine the specific behaviors around merchant accounts, credit cards, PayPal, etc.
